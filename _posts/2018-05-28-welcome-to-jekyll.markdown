Until now, all of my products and product details were hosted through Google Docs and Google Drive.  A week or so ago, I received private message from a user who was having trouble accessing the downloads from Google Drive.  Apparently, there is a bug that exists between newer Safari versions (specifically those that have the new Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature) and Google Drive that causes endless redirects.  I had been putting off building a website for my products for awhile, but I think now is a great time to start digging into it.  I'm not sure how long it will be until it is fully complete, but I will continue to work on it this summer.  Thanks!
