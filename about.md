My name is Joseph Lyons and I am a computer science student at Indiana University South Bend.  I have a deep interest in developing simple tools that make performing tasks easy.  I've released a few of my tools, such as Delay Time Calculator and Track Notes, 'out in to the wild.'  I hope that these tools can be useful for you.
